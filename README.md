# Awesome-Causal-Inference
A curated list of awesome work on causal inference, particularly in machine learning.

I am gathering resources (currently @ 72 papers) as literature for my PhD, and thought it may come in useful for others. This list includes work relating causal inference to deep learning, statistics, machine learning, and representation learning.
